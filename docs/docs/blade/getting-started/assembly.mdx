# Assembly

Out of the box the Compute Blade has some assembly required.

First, remove all for the yellow Kapton tape from the blade.

## Latch

The latch comes in two parts

{/* show the two parts */}

To assemble these two parts place the "lever" with the flat side down. Then place the second piece with the two mounting holes facing the table and press firmly until the pieces snap together.

Using a PH1 screw driver take the two M3x6 screws and secure the latch to the blade

The latch is now assembled and attached to the Compute Blade

## Compute Module

The Compute Blade is build to support the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4(CM4).

:::warning
Compute Blade is made for the CM4. Other compute modules may **NOT** work as intended on the Compute Blade as they are not officially tested
:::

Align the CM4 board to the board connecter on the Compute Blade

Then Press firmly until the CM4 is fully seated in the connecter.

## Heat Sink (Optional)

A heat sink is recommended to get the most out of your CM4. The Compute Blade heat sink is built to give your Compute Blade the best performance.
To install your heat sink, your CM4 must first be installed. See the above instructions if you need help. With the CM4 installed remove the plastic from the pre-applied thermal pads.

The place the heat sink on to the CM4. The text on the edge of the heat sink should be at the top of the blade.

The Heat sink can now be secured with the four included M2.5x8 screws. Using a PH1 screw driver tighten the screw to secure the heat sink.

:::warning
Do not over tighten the screws. Over tightening will cause the Compute Blade to bend.

The Heat Sink is now fully installed

Start by installing the brackets onto the Fan. The brackets are toolless and will snap right on.

### Connecting to Compute Blade
:::info
    The Fan Units are designed to work with the [Blade Runner™️](/blade-runner) enclosures
:::

:::danger
    Plugging the Compute Blade into the Fan Unit incorrectly may lead to permanent damage to the fan unit and the blade.

When connecting the blade to the Fan Unit the boards should be 90° relative to each other.
No additional work is need to make the Fan unit run.
